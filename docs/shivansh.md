- *Description:* Developed using HTML and CSS, this responsive portfolio highlights my skills with a clean, professional design. It features an education timeline, interactive typing animation, and effectively showcases key achievements and projects.
- *GitHub Repository* - https://github.com/goyalshivansh2805/portfolio
- *Hosted Link* - https://goyalshivansh.me/

- In this project, I developed skills to make a responsive portfolio with a unique design and features. I learned to apply animations, pseudo-elements like ::before, ::after.
  This Project increased my curiosity to learn and grow. One other things i learned is to use custom domains in vercel.

  Also, i got to know a lot of issues in it and i will try to fix all of them ASAP and also apply the suggestions suggested by seniors.

- **Description:** Developed using HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript, this ball shooter game features an engaging gameplay mechanic where the player fires bullets at approaching balls. Upon hitting a ball, an explosion animation is triggered. The game includes a recording system that tracks user input, allowing players to replay their actions with an auto-play feature for improved engagement.

- *Hosted Link* - https://animation-roan.vercel.app/

In this project, I improved my skills in creating real-time animations using JavaScript. I implemented a bullet shooting system, dynamic explosion effects, and developed an auto-play functionality using recorded events.I got to learn and develop a lot of logic for all these functionality which helped me improve my overall logic.I will be improving the game to make it more engaging.
