### Project 1: Guess The Pokemon Project

![Project 1](https://ibb.co/stX3z8B)

- *Description:* Guess the Pokémon" is an interactive web-based game where players are presented with a silhouette or partial image of a Pokémon, and they must guess the name of the Pokémon within a limited time. The game usually features input boxes where players type their guesses, which are then evaluated for accuracy. Based on the input, the game provides visual feedback—such as color changes (green for correct, red for incorrect)—and keeps track of the player's score or level.
