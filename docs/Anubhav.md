## Task 1 :

In the First Task I learned about using git and github . 
I learned about how to fork a repository to makes my persocal copy 
of the repository so that i can make changes in it and pull request to 
merge it to the original repo. I also learned about cloning a repository into 
my local system . Basically i learned using terminal and got to know many new different commands.

## Task 2 :

In the second task i made a personal portfolio website :

This was the first project i made using Html and Css . I learned about how a site is made responsive .
 I got to know about key frames , css animations and media query selector . I learned about pseudoclasses
  like hover . I leaned many basic things about a good website like overflow management ,importance of a 
  hamburger icon or a navbar etc . This was the first time i hosted a site on vercel . Although the project 
  i made has many flaw , i will try my best to correct them as soon as possible.

## Task 3 :

In the third task i made an animation.

<img src="https://ibb.co/tJDhWbn" alt="Error Displaying Image" width="823" height="539">

In this task, I created an animation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript where drops of water fall randomly from 
the top of the screen, and a bucket at the bottom can be moved to catch them. The project involved dynamically 
generating water drops and animating their fall, while the player controls the bucket's movement to collect the 
drops before they hit the ground. I utilized DOM manipulation to control the behavior of the elements and make the 
game interactive.

# My Learnings :
- I Gained hands-on experience in creating, modifying, and controlling elements using JavaScript.
- I improved my understanding of core JavaScript concepts, such as functions, event handling, and conditional statements.
- Learned how to use CSS transitions and JavaScript to create smooth, dynamic animations.
- Enhanced skills in structuring HTML elements and styling components with CSS to achieve the desired visual effect.
- Implemented logic to detect when water drops are caught by the bucket, introducing the concept of collision detection in animations.

<br>
This task was one of the most brainstorming task . I personally faced many different bugs while making this game.
Although the task was a tough one it gave us in-depth knowledge about game-development and hands on experience while developing a game. I would like to express my gratitute to my seniors who helped me to add many extra features . This was a team task .My teammate was Naitik Jain . We learned a lot from this project .

## My Learnings :
 - I learned about animating an image using sprite sheets .
 - I learned using canvas .
 - I got a deep undersstanding of game mechanics(player movement , collision detection) .
 - Practical implementation of oops using classes and objects.
 - Learned the importance of communication while working on a project as a team .
 - Got to know a lot about version control (Merging , pull request etc)
