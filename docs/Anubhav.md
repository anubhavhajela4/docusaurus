## Task 3 :

In the third task i made an animation.

<img src="https://ibb.co/tJDhWbn" alt="Error Displaying Image" width="823" height="539">

In this task, I created an animation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript where drops of water fall randomly from 
the top of the screen, and a bucket at the bottom can be moved to catch them. The project involved dynamically 
generating water drops and animating their fall, while the player controls the bucket's movement to collect the 
drops before they hit the ground. I utilized DOM manipulation to control the behavior of the elements and make the 
game interactive.

# My Learnings :
- I Gained hands-on experience in creating, modifying, and controlling elements using JavaScript.
- I improved my understanding of core JavaScript concepts, such as functions, event handling, and conditional statements.
- Learned how to use CSS transitions and JavaScript to create smooth, dynamic animations.
- Enhanced skills in structuring HTML elements and styling components with CSS to achieve the desired visual effect.
- Implemented logic to detect when water drops are caught by the bucket, introducing the concept of collision detection in animations.
